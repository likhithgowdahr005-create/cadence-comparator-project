# CMOS Comparator – Cadence Virtuoso

This repository contains the design and simulation of a CMOS comparator
implemented using Cadence Virtuoso. The comparator is designed as a
building block for a Sigma–Delta Modulator.

## Tool Used
- Cadence Virtuoso (Analog Design Environment)

## Library Name
- comparator

## Cells Included
- **comp** : CMOS comparator schematic and symbol  
- **comp_tb** : Comparator testbench  
- **comp_test** : Top-level transient simulation  

## Simulations
- Transient analysis to verify comparator switching behavior  
- Input: sinusoidal signal  
- Output: digital-like comparator response  

## Screenshots
The `screenshots/` folder contains:
- Comparator schematic  
- Transient response waveform  

## Project Team
This project was carried out as a group mini-project.
